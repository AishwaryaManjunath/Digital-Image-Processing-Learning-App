Because the basic principle that is followed by the cameras has been taken from the way , the human eye works. \n When light falls upon the particular object , it is reflected back after striking through the object. The rays of light when passed through the lens of eye , form a particular angle , and the image is formed on the retina which is the back side of the wall. The image that is formed is inverted. This image is then interpreted by the brain and that makes us able to understand things. Due to angle formation , we are able to perceive the height and depth of the object we are seeing. This has been more explained in the tutorial of perspective transformation. "

            android:text="\n Like analog cameras , in the case of digital too , when light falls on the object , the light reflects back after striking the object and allowed to enter inside the camera. \n Each sensor of the CCD array itself is an analog sensor. When photons of light strike on the chip , it is held as a small electrical charge in each photo sensor. The response of each sensor is directly equal to the amount of light or (photon) energy striked on the surface of the sensor. \n Since we have already define an image as a two dimensional signal and due to the two dimensional formation of the CCD array , a complete image can be achieved from this CCD array. \n It has limited number of sensors , and it means a limited detail can be captured by it. Also each sensor can have only one value against the each photon particle that strike on it. \n So the number of photons striking(current) are counted and stored. In order to measure accurately these , external CMOS sensors are also attached with CCD array. \n Introduction to pixel \n The value of each sensor of the CCD array refers to each the value of the individual pixel. The number of sensors = number of pixels. It also means that each sensor could have only one and only one value. \n Storing image \n The charges stored by the CCD array are converted to voltage one pixel at a time. With the help of additional circuits , this voltage is converted into a digital information and then it is stored. \n Each company that manufactures digital camera, make their own CCD sensors. That include , Sony , Mistubishi , Nikon ,Samsung , Toshiba , FujiFilm , Canon e.t.c. \n Apart from the other factors , the quality of the image captured also depends on the type and quality of the CCD array that has been used.
